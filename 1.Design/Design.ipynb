    "Sales Force Health Cloud is one of the largest medical CRMs in Australia. Sales Force has identified an opportunity to expand their medical product to incorporate medical forecasting for patients using AI/ML models. In Australia, Diabetes prevalence has slowly increased over the last twenty years, from 3.3% in 2001 to 5.3% in 2022. Sales Force background research has identified that Doctors often underestimate the progress of type II adult-onset diabetes after diagnosis. Often resulting in insufficient medical interventions and reduced health outcomes for patients. Sales Force has approached you as a Data Engineer to develop a PoC diabetes forecasting service for doctors to provide a valid and reliable prediction of the disease progression over the patient's next 12 months based on data in a patient's CRM record.\n",
